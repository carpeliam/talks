# Isomorphic React

* Rendering JS on the server is what's coming
* Competition is good, framework lock-in is bad - this stuff plays well with others

## Benefits
* SEO, indexability
* easier code maintenance
* free progressive enhancement - if JS isn't enabled on client, page is still rendered
* accessibility
* faster perceived load time / better global UX (internet speeds suck worldwide)
* better overall UX
