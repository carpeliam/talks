<h2>Iceland doesn't have much genetic variation, which is ideal for isolating genes.</h2>

    <p>Iceland's genetic isolation (pop: 320,000) and unrivaled genealogical records made it a potential gold mine for isolating genes</p>
    <p>Almost 3 years after this article was published, deCODE (the organization that bid to collect the DNA of Iceland's citizens) went bankrupt when the Icelandic economy tanked, and was picked up in 2012 by Amgen, an American company. (DNA is pretty valuable, but at the time, it was expensive to sequence, and is still hard to monetize. Amgen now owns the genetic information, but it can't actually physically leave Iceland due to Icelandic "biobank" laws.) deCODE was able to genotype the DNA for ~140,000 volunteers over 10+ years, and sequenced the DNA of about 2,600 people. They don't really need to sequence the DNA of everybody, because since Iceland has so little genetic variation, they can infer the genomes of the 140,000 based on those of the 2,600.</p>
