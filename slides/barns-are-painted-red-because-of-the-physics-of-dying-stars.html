<aside class="notes">
    Barns are painted red because red paint is cheap.
    Red paint is cheap because the ingredient in red paint, red ochre (2 irons, 3 oxygens), is plentiful.
    When a star starts to die, it starts to shrink, and as it shrinks, you get a lot of pressure, which leads to an increase in heat, and these fusion reactions lead to the star emitting heavier and heavier elements. The heaviest element it can emit? Iron.
