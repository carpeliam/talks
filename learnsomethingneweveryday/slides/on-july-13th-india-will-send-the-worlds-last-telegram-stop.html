  <p>Last telegraph: DEAR SIR - WISH YOU ALL SUCESS AND HAPPYNESS IN LIFE, MAY YOU ATTAIN GLORIES OF THE GREATMAN OF THE PAST</p>
    (Editor's Note: The original story incorrectly heralded the worldwide demise of the telegram. In fact, some telegram services live on, including an international telegram service that will continue to operate in India even as the state-run service is shutting down.)
