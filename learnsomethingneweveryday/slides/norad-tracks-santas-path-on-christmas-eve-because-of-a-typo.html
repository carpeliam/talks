<aside class="notes">
    In 1955, Sears placed ads asking kids to call various local phone numbers to reach Santa.
    The local Colorado Springs number was a typo and actually reached the Continental Air Defense Command (CONAD), predecessor to NORAD.
    When a little girl called, a colonel answered, and was mad at first, but then played along and asked her what she wanted for Christmas.
    The pretending evolved into charting Santa's progress, and a tradition was born.
