# HTML5 Homesteading: Bringing Back the Spirit of Geocities for the Modern Web
* The social individuality of GeoCities has been replaced with a textarea (Twitter)
* An answer: NeoCities
	* open-sourced
	* no ads
	* this is NOT just nostalgia
* resource portal
* restore anonymity
* make things that persist. regular html
* make beautiful things
* teach the future
	* teachers have used neocities to teach within their classroom
* old ideas meet modern technology
	* it's not anachronistic - the point is not to harken back to GeoCities
	* easy site browsing via phantomjs
	* activity feed
	* web rings replaced by tags
* problems along the way: spam, viruses, warez, DDoS attacks, legal threats
* next steps
	* get media attention
	* improve tooling, functionality
	* make the site stay up **forever** (w/IPFS)
	
The web used to be fun. We can make it fun again.
