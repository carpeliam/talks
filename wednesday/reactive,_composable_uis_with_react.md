# Reactive, Composable UIs with React: One Year Later

## Why React?
DHH: Creating compelling frameworks is best done by extracting them from real-world applications you've actually worked on (zing, Angular!)

* "State Changing *over time* is the root of all evil"
* Imperative vs Declarative

"Every time data changes it's like hitting Refresh in a server rendered app"

* React will find the minimal amount of changes to the DOM needed to create a new state
* Performance however is not what makes React special; the virtual DOM is not the original purpose of React
* React: Functional (there's value in the right, but we value the left more)
	* Functional over OO
	* Stateless over Stateful
	* Clarity over Brevity
* Functional: composition of functions as primary mechanism for building programs
*
