# Designing for the Future: Architecting Code and Systems with Long-Term Growth and Development in Mind

The most important thing: meeting your users' needs

* Consistency makes McDonald's, Google, Craigslist successful
* To make code durable, program with the programmer in mind
* Clarity > efficiency
* weed the garden - if you're not sure if you should fix something you find, do it
* read "two pillars of js"
* Modularity
	* adaptability
	* can support optimized loading
	* enables testing
	* modularize based on volatility - what's likely to change (O'Reilly webcast: "Zen of Software Architecture")
* let machines do what they do best - use a build system, templates
* tests (like wings) provide both lift and drag - you need just the right size/shape to fly
	* require setup, maintenance, integration, and increases feedback loop time
* growth/scaling
	* cache
	* project growth curve, upgrade 12-18 months
	* think globally
	* unicode
	* Build your tools - write code that will help you do less work
